# Questionnaire Survey for the Repository Tagging Issue

To assess whether the issue is an isolated event or not, we conducted a [questionnaire survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScf_aY8GYvqLvNgJmfypnucpocSpky4MaqI0iFI0sH_tXCgAg/viewform) with 68 researchers and 32 engineers who have different years of experiences and insights on the field of software engineering. The surveyed results are summarized into a table listed below.

From the surveyed results, we can observe that:

- 66% of participants believed that repositories on major platforms like GitHub are not well-categorized , and many specifically pointed out issues such as “repos have no tags or irrelevant ones” and “duplicate or conflicting tags across projects” (see Q5, Q5a).

- Meanwhile, 82% of respondents reported that they had experienced difficulties in finding relevant repositories due to missing categories for new technologies, inconsistent naming conventions, and misspelled tagging (see Q6, Q6a). 

- In addition to this, 87% of the investigators believe more accurate and consistent repository tags would improve their productivity (e.g., in searching, organizing, or recommending repositories) (see Q7). 

- All of these responses highlights the practical importance of proper Software Repository Categorization and current categorization mechanism of software repository hosting platforms has not fully meet the expectations of practitioners, and there lacks an effective way to address these obstacles to better organize and manage software repositories on such hosting platforms for both practitioners and researchers.
